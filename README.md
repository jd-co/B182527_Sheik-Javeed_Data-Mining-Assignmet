# Data_Mining_Assignment
This is assignment of Data Mining on Classification(Machine Learning)

Before selecting Machine learning model for classsification in both the datasets , I have Used lazyclassifer which gives accuracy and f1 score of all 29 classification models.

For breask cancer classification I have used SVC beecause it is giving 97% accuracy.

For Iris dataset classification  I have used Random Forest Algorithm because it is giving 100% accuuracy.
